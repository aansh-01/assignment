        Elephants are usually black or dark grey in colour. Although rare, white elephants also exist. Male elephants have long curved tusks. Though these are its teeth, tusks are not used for eating. Elephants like to eat fruit, shrubs and leaves. In cities, people can be seen feeding bananas to elephants.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 68, 45);">Elephants are very strong and used by humans to carry heavy loads. They can lift and roll big logs. They are used for riding in wildlife sanctuaries. Even though it is a very large animal, an elephant can run quite fast and swim too. Like human beings, family is very important to elephants. They live in herds.</p> 
<p style="color: rgb(4, 0, 255);">Elephants are found in many jungles and sanctuaries around the world. But many have also been domesticated. Their keepers are called ‘mahouts’. There is something regal and royal about elephants.</p>
